- **Worker Name**: The host name configured by the mining program,If it is not configured as the same host name, the data of multiple workers will be combined for statistics.
- **Hashrate/15min**: The average hashrate in the last 15 minutes. Some big flunctuations may occur if workers are running less than 15 minutes.
- **Hashrate/24h**: The average hashrate in the last 24 hours. Some big flunctuations may occur if workers are running less than 24 hours
- **Export**: Export worker running status locally as needed.
- **Group**: The group of current workers. For more details, please refer to [Worker Group](/en/_document/miner_group)ã€‚

 > ***ZKRush uses p/s as the computing power unit when calculating aleo computing power, that is, the number of hashes per second; if you need the data per minute, please multiply the result by 60***
